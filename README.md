# Dear people of the future

Hello guys!

My name is Robert Georges (born Rafat Petros-Gorguis), I wrote this message as part of the Github Archive Program, 1 hour before the archiving start. I hope everything is good for you and you will be able to read this :-).

I'm a 29 years old Software engineer from Paris. I wrote my first line of code 15 years ago, and never left programming since that day. My favorite language is the D programming language, a powerful general-purpose programming language. You can find it on this platform with the keyword "dlang". I'm actually writing a little game engine with it (evael).

My father left Irak for France in 1991, when the country was at war. I would like to give a big <3 to my family: 

- Baba (Hekmat)
- Mama (Soaad)
- Rami
- Ronak
- David
- Marie
- Mathilda

Here is a picture of my parents:
